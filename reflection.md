# What Copilot Generated
Copilot generated the ```remove_non_positive_values(df)``` function and the ```handle_missing_values(df)``` function.
I wrote comments of what I wanted to be completed and then watched it execute it. I ran through it and made sure there were
no errors. I had to make a few adjustments.

# What I Modified
Copilot did a couple things incorrectly. It got the names of the columns incorrect.
For example, it would put the quantity column as ```df["quantity"]``` when the actual name of the quantity column is ```"qty"```.
and with price it did something very similar. It put the price column as ```"Price"``` as it capitalized the P, even though I wrote 
the code earlier that forced the column names to be lowercase.

# What I Learned
I learned that the Github workflow is not as hard as I inititally thought it would be. At first, I struggled a bit
and was confused, but I eventually figured it out. I really like the commits feature to keep track of the stuff I modify
and what I did. It is a really cool feature.
